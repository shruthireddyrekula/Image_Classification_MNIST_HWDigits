# Image_Classification_MNIST_HWDigits(keras)

This is a quick introduction to use tensorflow for image classification problem using MNIST handwritten digits using keras API with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D and dense layers with relu and softmax activation functions. Here are the steps we perform in this colab notebook:

1) Load train and test data 

2) Preprocess the images

3) Train the model on training data with adam optimizer and categorical_crossentropy loss.

4) Get the model predictions on test images


# Data

Size of train data: 60000 images.
 
Sixe of test data: 10000 images

# Results

Train accuracy 98.7% with 0.0383 loss

Validation accuracy 98.5% with 0.046898 loss
